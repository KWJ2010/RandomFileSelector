# **RandomFileSelector**
Simple program intended to randomly copy files from one location to another

##**ABOUT**

####This is a personal project to showcase a few concepts I've been thinking about.


####I am not looking for the feedback and help that can come from having an open-source project, so this is not open-source.

####Feel free to look at this code as an indication to what I have learned over the past year of working with C#/WPF.  This is a learning experience for me. I hope that in this process that others may learn from my experience.

####*All Rights of these files and Code ("The Software") are reserved.* Yes I know that this is a *public* repository, yes I like open source, but this project is **not** open-source.


####This project is a first for me in many ways:
1. The first public repository I have created
2. The first public code I have uploaded
3. the first list I have made in markdown
4. In fact, this is the *first* markdown I have ever written!
5. In the code there are a lot of new features that I am working on, so if you find this project before it is stable, please be patient with my progress, and send me a message if you are interested in this project


##**PROJECT GOALS**

#### -[ ] Broaden my skills with GitHub, C#, .NET, WPF, XAML, & MVVM
#### -[ ] Create basic desktop application to copy a randomized selection of music files onto a USB drive
#### -[ ] Update the basic functioning application with my more advanced features list
#### -[ ] Rebuild this program as a python based Command line executable
#### -[ ] Rebuild this program with a web interface instead of the xaml one.
